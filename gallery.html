                    Here I can provide you with some of my creative works, as well as show you a bit of who I am. All of
                    the following pictures were taken by yours truly. As you can see, my dogs are my best friends, and I
                    wouldn't be able to envision my life without them! All of the following pictures of my dogs were
                    taken my me, and I continuously try to take good photography of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The subsequent images, following my dogs, are reflective of my creative works. Whether it be me
                    playing the piano, or some physically creative works of mine. When it comes to creative activities,
                    I don't typically draw, I enjoy other creative activities, reflected in the gallery, such as:
                    pumpkin carving, chalk art, keyboard builds, wood blocks, and ceramics painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My most recent artistic activities include keyboard builds and ceramics painting. All of these
                    photographs are snapshots of myself and have served as life lessons for me. They all required in
                    immense amount of time and planning, research, and have provided a high level of satisfaction,
                    pride, and achievement. Not to mention, they were all quite therapeutic.

                        My dogs required a lot of planning, patience, love, and empathy. In turn, they become my
                        greatest friends and I couldn't imagine my life without them.

                        Piano, as aforementioned, is something that continues to teach me new lessons. Anytime you learn
                        something new, you will fail, but only then can you truly learn how to play it.
                    </li>

                        All of the following photographs were activities that required patience, planning, research, and
                        a willingness to work with my mistakes; in all of these last 5 photographs (and activities they
                        capture), if I made a mistake, they were permanent, so they taught me how to embrace mistakes
                        and incorporate them into the art.
