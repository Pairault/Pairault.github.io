                        <h2>Academic Career</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering
                            (CSSE) and a minor in Business Administration. I am working part-time and have a strong
                            interest in continuing to work in in cybersecurity.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
                        <p>
                            In addition to my expected responsibilities for my role, I am going beyond and working in
                            other domains such as defensive security and offensive security. My career trajectory is to
                            continue working in governance and compliance, while also enhancing my skillset in
                            additional cybersecurity domains. My hope is that I can positively impact as many people as
                            possible with my career.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have learned a great deal in my short experience in cybersecurity, and I have learned how
                            difficult it is to maintain a secure organization, as well as ensure security and privacy
                            for customer and client data. I believe that every individual has a right to security and
                            privacy, and I truly hope that, as a part of my career trajectory, I can help make this a
                            reality.
