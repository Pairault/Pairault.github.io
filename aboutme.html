                <p>
                    I am currently a student at the University of Washington, and I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in
                    Computer Science and Software Engineering; in addition, I am also pursuing a minor in Business
                    Administration.

                <h3>More about my personal hobbies and interestsâ€¦</h3>
                <ul class="hobbies">
                    <li>
                        I love to play the piano and I believe that music is one of the greatest things in the world!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have developed a fascination and love for building keyboards. It has become an expensive
                        hobby,
                        but also extremely gratifying and therapeutic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have two loving, wonderful dogs. They are probably the two things I love most in this world,
                        and
                        if I could spend all day playing with them, I would!!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Currently in development, are some of my personal values:</h3>
                <h4>Learning Never Stops</h4>
                <p>
                    This is one my current employer's mission statements: Echelon Risk + Cyber. When I went through
                    their mission statements, prior to an interview, this mission statement spoke to me. I connected
                    very deeply with it, and I truly believe that it is impossible to stop learning. There will
                    always be new things to learn in this world. For example, I learned so much about coding in HTML
                    by building this website. The caveat to this value is that learning can only stop when you
                    choose it to stop. I want to be someone who will never choose to stop learning!
                </p>
                <h4>Kindness is One of the Greatest Gifts You can Give</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a personal value that I came up with, although it isn't an all-original idea. I am lucky
                    to have grown up in a family that could support me, love me, and help me excel in the world. I
                    am lucky to have made such wonderful and caring friendships that have lasted a long time. I
                    believe that without all of their kindness and support, I would not have been able to thrive.
